# Scramblebot.com-Scrambler

This is a Ceaasar Cypher Java application that was made for <a href="http://www.scramblebot.com" target="_blank">scramblebot.com</a> some time ago, but it was never released until now.

It's functional, but incomplete. 

If you just want to use it as a Ceasar cyper app, download the ScramblebotCeasearCypher.jar file.

ScramblebotCeasarCypher.jar is a runnable jar, and should work on most systems that have a recent version of Java installed.
